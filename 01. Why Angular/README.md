# WHy AnGuLar ?

Angular is a frontend framework developed and maintained by Google to build large-scale, maintainable, and enterprise-grade web applications.

Angular was introduced to solve the architectural and scalability problems that arise when JavaScript applications grow beyond simple UI scripts.

## ❓ Problem Before Angular

Before Angular, web development mainly relied on:

- Plain JavaScript

- jQuery

- Scattered DOM manipulation

This caused:

- No clear project structure

- Business logic mixed with UI logic

- Difficult testing and debugging

- Poor maintainability in large applications

As applications grew, JavaScript code became unmanageable, especially for enterprise systems like dashboards, portals, and government or corporate application

## 🧠 Why Angular Was Introduced

Angular was created to:

- Enforce structure and discipline in frontend development

- Enable Single Page Applications (SPA)

- Separate data, logic, and UI

- Support large teams and long-term projects

> Angular treats frontend not as scripting, but as application engineering.

## ⚙️ Core Reasons to Choose Angular

### 1️⃣ Structured Architecture

Angular enforces a clear structure using:

- Modules

- Components

- Services

- Routing

This makes the application:

- Easy to understand

- Easy to scale

- Easy to maintain

### 2️⃣ TypeScript Support (Big Advantage)

Angular uses TypeScript by default, which provides:

- Strong typing

- Compile-time error detection

- Better IDE support

- Cleaner and safer code

### 3️⃣ Dependency Injection (Enterprise Feature)

Angular has built-in Dependency Injection, similar to Spring Framework.

Benefits:

- Loose coupling

- Better testability

- Reusable services

### 4️⃣ Two-Way Data Binding

Angular automatically synchronizes:

- UI ↔ Data Model

### 5️⃣ Built-in Features (No Guesswork)

Angular provides:

- Routing

- Forms (Template & Reactive)

- HTTP Client

- Validation

- Lifecycle hooks
